# Intuition

This code is checking if two binary trees, represented by the TreeNode objects 'p' and 'q', are identical. It does this by comparing the results of a pre-order traversal of both trees. A pre-order traversal visits the root node first, then recursively visits the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. By comparing the values obtained from the traversals of both trees, the code can determine if the two trees are identical.

# Approach

The code first calls the preorderTraversal() method on both TreeNode objects, 'p' and 'q'. This method takes a tree's root node as its input and returns a List of integers representing the values obtained from a pre-order traversal of the tree. The values in the lists obtained from the traversals of both trees are then compared using the equals() method. If the lists are identical, the trees are identical and the method returns true. If the lists are different, the trees are different and the method returns false.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the preorderTraversal method visits each node once. Since the method is called twice, once on each of the trees, the total time complexity of the isSameTree() method is O(2n)= O(n).

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity of this code is O(n) as well, because the preorderTraversal method stores all the values of the tree in a list, and the maximum size of this list is n where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

    public static boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // we compare two list that are returned by pre-oder traversal of the two trees
        // if they are equal it means tree are equal and vice versa
        return preorderTraversal(p).equals(preorderTraversal(q));

    }

    public static List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        // base condition
        if(root == null){
            // return a null element when the node is null
            list.add(null);
            return list;
        }
        // add the value of node to list
        list.add(root.val);
        // recurse first on the left part then on the right part
        list.addAll(preorderTraversal(root.left));
        list.addAll(preorderTraversal(root.right));
