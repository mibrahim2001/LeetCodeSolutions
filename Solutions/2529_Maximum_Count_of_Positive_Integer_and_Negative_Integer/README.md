# Intuition

This code is counting the number of positive and negative numbers in the given array and returning the maximum count of either positive or negative numbers.

# Approach

The code iterates through the array, and for each element, it checks whether it is positive or negative. If it is positive, the positive count is incremented by 1. If it is negative, the negative count is incremented by 1. At the end, the maximum of the positive and negative counts is returned.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity of this code is O(n), as the number of operations performed is directly proportional to the size of the input array.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity of this code is O(1), as the space required does not depend on the size of the input array. Only a few variables are used to store the counts of positive and negative numbers, which are constant in size.

# Code

```
class Solution {
    public int maximumCount(int[] nums) {
        int pos = 0;
        int neg = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i]>0){
                pos++;
            }
            else if(nums[i]<0){
                neg++;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(pos,neg);
    }
}
```
