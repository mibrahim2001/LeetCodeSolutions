# Intuition

This code is trying to determine the maximum number of ice creams that can be purchased given a list of costs and a number of coins. It does this by sorting the costs in ascending order and then iterating through the costs, buying an ice cream if the cost is less than or equal to the number of coins left.

# Approach

The approach taken is to sort the costs in ascending order and then iterate through the costs, buying an ice cream if the cost is less than or equal to the number of coins left. If the cost is greater than the number of coins left, the loop breaks and the final result is returned.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity of this code is O(n _ log(n)) because the costs are sorted using the Arrays.sort() method, which has a time complexity of O(n _ log(n)).

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity of this code is O(1) because the sorting is done in place and no additional space is used.

# Code

```
class Solution {
    public int maxIceCream(int[] costs, int coins) {
         // Sort the costs in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(costs);

        // Initialize the number of ice creams that can be bought to 0
        int result = 0;

        // Iterate through all costs
        for (int cost : costs) {
            // If the cost of the current ice cream is less than or equal to the number of
            // coins left,
            // then buy the ice cream
            if (cost <= coins) {
                result++;
                // Update the number of coins left
                coins -= cost;
            }
            // Otherwise, stop buying ice creams
            else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
