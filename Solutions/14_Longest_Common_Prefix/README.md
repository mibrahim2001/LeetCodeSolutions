# Intuition

This code is finding the longest common prefix among a list of strings. A common prefix is a sequence of characters that appear at the beginning of all the strings in the list. For example, if the list of strings is ["apple", "application", "apply"], the common prefix is "ap".

# Approach

The approach used in this code is to sort the list of strings and then compare the first and last strings in the sorted list. This is because the common prefix will always appear at the beginning of the first string and the end of the last string in the sorted list. The code then iterates through the characters of the first and last string and compares them. If they are the same, it adds the character to a variable storing the common prefix. If they are different, it returns the common prefix.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity of this approach is O(nlog(n)) where n is the number of strings. This is because the sorting of the strings takes O(nlog(n)) time and the comparison of the first and last string takes O(min(length of first string, length of last string)) time.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are only storing the common prefix and not any other data structure.

# Code

```
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
           if (strs.length == 0) {
        return "";
    }

    // Sort the list of strings to make the search for the common prefix more efficient
    Arrays.sort(strs);
    // Get the first and last string in the sorted list
    String firstStr = strs[0];
    String lastStr = strs[strs.length - 1];

    // Initialize a variable to store the common prefix
    String commonPrefix = "";
    // Iterate through the characters in the first and last String

    for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(firstStr.length(), lastStr.length()); i++) {
        // If the characters are the same, add it to the common prefix
        if (firstStr.charAt(i) == lastStr.charAt(i)) {
            commonPrefix += firstStr.charAt(i);
        }
        // If the characters are different, return the common prefix
        else {
            return commonPrefix;
        }
    }
    // If the common prefix is an empty string, return an empty string
    if (commonPrefix.isEmpty()) {
        return "";
    }
    // Return the common prefix
    return commonPrefix;
    }
}
```
